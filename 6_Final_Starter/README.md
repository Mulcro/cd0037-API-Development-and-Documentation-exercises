# The Grand Bookshelf 

Welcome to the Grand Bookshelf. Here you will find a grand and vast array of books. Each book comes with it's author and a given rating that has been based off of [Book Review](https://www.bookreview.com). 

We were really motivated to create this API as we noticed a gap in the book API's currently available. We also really love books and really wanted to work on this :)


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites & Instalation
#### Backend
To get started on the backend first install all the required modules in the `requirements.txt` file.

```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After this create a virtual enviroment in the backend directory

```
python -m venv venv
```
activate the virtual enviroment and cd into the flaskr directory. Once there pip install flask, flask_sqlalchemy, flask_cors and psycopg2

```
venv\Scripts\activate
cd flaskr
pip install flask, flask_sqlalchemy, flask_cors, psycopg2
```

Finally to run the server run it using python

```
python __init__.py

```

### Frontend
Cd into the frontend directory and install dependacies then run

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Testing
To test the API cd into the backend. Once their simple run the test_flaskr.py file with python.

```
cd backend
python test_flaskr.py
```

## API Reference

- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. 
- Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys. 

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Not Processable 

### Endpoints 
#### GET /books
- General:
    - Returns a list of book objects, success value, and total number of books
    - Results are paginated in groups of 8. Include a request argument to choose page number, starting from 1. 
- Sample: `curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/books`
